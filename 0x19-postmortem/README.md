Incident Report: The Great Database Meltdown of February 28, 2025

Issue Summary

On February 28, 2025, from 14:15 WAT to 15:45 WAT (1 hour 30 minutes), our main web application decided to take an unscheduled nap, affecting approximately 40% of users. During this time, users experienced slow load times, intermittent errors (HTTP 500), and failed transactions, resulting in widespread panic and a flurry of "Is the site down?" Slack messages. The root cause? An unoptimized background job that went rogue, hammering our poor database into exhaustion.

Timeline

14:15 WAT – Monitoring alerts screamed about high API response times. We ignored it for 30 seconds, hoping it would fix itself.

14:18 WAT – The Engineering team acknowledged the alert and frantically opened dashboards.

14:25 WAT – Initial assessment: "Huh, that's weird."

14:35 WAT – Database logs revealed an explosion of active connections. Oh boy.

14:50 WAT – Assumed the culprit was a recent query optimization patch. Initiated a rollback while crossing my fingers.

15:00 WAT – Rollback completed. No improvement. Cue more stress sweating.

15:10 WAT – Finally discovered an unoptimized background job was having a field day with our database.

15:20 WAT – Paused the background job. Instantly, peace was restored, birds chirped, and the database sighed in relief.

15:45 WAT – Service fully restored. Engineers added "survive another outage" to their resumes.


Root Cause and Resolution

The outage was caused by a misbehaving background job introduced in a recent update. This job, meant to process large user data sets asynchronously, went rogue and flooded our database with excessive queries, leading to total chaos.

To fix this:

We paused the job, instantly stopping the madness.

We analyzed the logic of the job and realized it was about as efficient as using a fork to eat soup.

A hotfix was deployed to limit concurrent database connections from background processes and introduce more sanity into query execution.


Corrective and Preventative Measures

To avoid another database-induced heart attack, we are implementing the following improvements:

- Teach background jobs some manners by optimizing queries.

- Enforce connection limits so no single process can hoard all the database resources like a greedy raccoon.

- Enhance monitoring alerts to shout at us earlier when things start going south.

- Conduct proper load testing before deploying changes that can wreck production.

- Improve rollback mechanisms so we don’t waste time playing detective.

- Update deployment protocols to ensure performance analysis is a thing we actually do.



Action Items:
By implementing these measures, we hope to keep our database happy, our engineers sane, and our users blissfully unaware of future near-disasters.
